# chainring

Project in work currently. 

This was my weekend project with ChatGPT to make a program that can read cadence, speed. By cadence and speed it identifies the gear i am used at that moment. 

Currently it accepts only 1 chainring in front. Then it would try to simulate what gear i would be using if the chainrings were bigger or smaller and calculates which setup would be the best by see which gear combo uses mostly gears in the middle of cassette where it is the most effective.

Speed has to be calculated by magnet sensor. GPS is not accurate enough.
